JavaScript Quiz App

This is a quiz app I built on my own based on the specs I received from the Freemote Program I took:

Specs
1. You'll need 2 files for this one. First, this text list of quiz questions and second, this image that you can use for the design.

2. Create your folder structure from scratch in CodePen.

3. Create HTML elements for each quiz question, including the name of the quiz, each question, and all answers for each question, (each of which should have a radio button to select).

4. Create some CSS styling to match the design, based on the image in the folder you downloaded. 

5. Now, we only want to show one question at once, so hide all of the questions except for the first one. 

6. Let's add JavaScript functionality to the "Next" button, to advance which question is shown on the screen (big hint: try adding a numerical index to each question, and then an "activeQuestion" javascript variable)

7. Once you have the "Next" button showing just one question at a time, add JavaScript to update the question index text (ex, Question 1 out of 4, see design)

8. Once we get to the end of the questions, let's display the user's score on the page (how many questions they got right!)
